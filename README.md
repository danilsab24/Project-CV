# ASL Hand Gesture Detection
This repository contains code for creating a dataset for ASL hand gesture detection, training a deep learning model, and testing the trained model. The datasets used and pre-trained models are available for download at the provided links.

## Abstract
Hand gesture detection is a pivotal task in the realm of human-computer interaction, particularly in recognizing the letters of the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet from hand movements. By accurately interpreting these gestures, it becomes possible to bridge communication gaps for individuals who rely on sign language. The codes in this repository demonstrate how different models vary in their suitability for addressing this task, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach. By leveraging advanced algorithms and deep learning models, we aim to develop a robust system capable of identifying ASL gestures in real-time, thereby facilitating improved learning and communication for both learners and users of sign language.
